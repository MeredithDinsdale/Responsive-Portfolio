      <p>I am a new student of web development, enrolled in a full stack coding bootcamp put on by the University of Oregon and Trilogy Education Services.
            Up until last month I was working for a recreational cannabis company as their director of production. My job involved a lot of problem solving and decision making and deciding what to do with moldy weed. I decided I wanted to try something new. I'm liking this coding stuff and looking forward to learning more.</p>
